This is a live bootable iso of the Crunchbang Statler linux operating system that has been customized
to include the LAMP stack and developer tools. It also includes a working Florida DrupalCamp Drupal
installation to use for the beginner sessions.

This came about due to the overhead required to install and configure MAMP/XAMPP on beginner's computers
the day of the DrupalCamp so that they can have a working Drupal installation to follow along with.

Camp organizers can burn muliple copies of this disc to hand to participants on the day of the camp. 

Simply insert the disc and boot from it.

The login username is drupal and the password is also drupal.

The mysql password is root.
